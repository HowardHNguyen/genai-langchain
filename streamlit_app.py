This application is a **Marketing Operations AI Assistant (Agentic Prototype)** designed to help Marketing teams work faster, more consistently, and with greater confidence by grounding AI responses in **our internal documentation, standards, and operating model**.

It is **not a replacement for Microsoft Copilot**.  
Instead, it complements Copilot by focusing on **marketing-specific knowledge and workflows** that generic enterprise AI tools do not reliably capture.

---

### Why this matters

Marketing organizations often struggle with:
- Inconsistent definitions (KPIs, attribution, lifecycle stages)
- Knowledge spread across decks, PDFs, playbooks, and SOPs
- Repeated questions about “how we do things here”
- Time lost translating strategy into execution details

This assistant addresses those gaps by acting as a **single, trusted intelligence layer** over approved Marketing content.

---

### What this assistant does today

- Ingests internal marketing documents (guidelines, frameworks, playbooks)
- Retrieves the most relevant content based on user questions
- Generates answers **grounded in internal sources**, reducing hallucination
- Helps users:
  - Clarify definitions and operating rules
  - Summarize policies and standards
  - Draft internal-ready artifacts (briefs, checklists, SOPs)

This prototype demonstrates the **core agentic loop**:  
**Retrieve → Reason → Respond**, using our content as the source of truth.

---

### How this complements Microsoft Copilot

Microsoft Copilot excels at:
- General productivity
- Cross-tool assistance (Outlook, Teams, PowerPoint, Excel)
- Broad language understanding

This assistant focuses on:
- Marketing-specific standards and definitions
- Operational consistency and governance
- Domain-aware reasoning tied to how Marketing actually operates

Together, they form a layered model:
- **Copilot** → general enterprise productivity  
- **Marketing Operations AI Assistant** → domain-specific enablement and intelligence

---

### What this can evolve into

With further investment, this prototype can mature into a daily-use **Agentic Marketing Enablement Tool**, capable of:
- Assisting campaign setup and QA
- Enforcing standards at execution time
- Supporting analytics interpretation and experimentation design
- Powering guided workflows (e.g., “create a campaign brief”, “validate a launch checklist”)
- Integrating with MarTech, analytics, and data platforms

---

### Important note

This is an **exploratory, internal prototype** intended to demonstrate feasibility, collect stakeholder feedback, and inform a broader Agentic AI strategy for Marketing.

We evaluate this like an internal operations tool, not a chatbot.
It’s reliable because it’s grounded in our own documents, consistent because it enforces our definitions, and useful because it reduces time spent searching and clarifying.
The prototype proves the core loop works. The next step is governance, integration, and scale.

- Enterprise-grade governance, access control, persistence, and integrations would be addressed prior to any production deployment.

# TAB 3: HOW TO USE
# =========================
with tab_howto:
    st.header("How to use / guideline")

    st.markdown(
        """
### Quick start
1. **Upload** your docs (PDF, TXT, DOCX, etc.)
2. Click **Build Knowledge Base**
3. Ask questions in the chat

### Best practices (for stronger answers)
- Ask **specific questions** (e.g., “What is our definition of MQL?” vs “Explain MQL”)
- Provide context in your question: channel, market, product line, timeframe
- If you want a specific output format, request it (e.g., “Answer as a checklist”)

### Example questions
- “Summarize our modern marketing operations framework in 10 bullets.”
- “What does our guideline say about attribution models and limitations?”
- “Draft a campaign brief template aligned with our definitions.”
- “Create a QA checklist for email + paid social launch based on our standards.”

### Limitations (current prototype)
- The knowledge base is built from **uploaded docs only** (not yet connected to Drive/Confluence/Slack)
- Citations are not shown as clickable sources yet (can be added next)
- Index is stored in memory per session (can be upgraded to persistent storage)

### Data handling note
Avoid uploading restricted or highly sensitive documents until we add governance controls:
access control, audit logs, encryption, and retention policies.

### Current prototype vs. production evolution

**Today (Prototype)**
- In-memory knowledge index
- Session-based usage
- Manual document upload

**Future (Production-ready)**
- Persistent vector storage
- Role-based access control
- Source citations and traceability
- Integration with enterprise systems (Drive, Confluence, SharePoint, MarTech tools)
- Observability (usage, cost, quality metrics)

---

### Why this architecture was chosen

- Modular: each layer can evolve independently
- Enterprise-aligned: supports governance and scale
- Agent-ready: designed to expand beyond Q&A into workflow automation

This architecture provides a **safe, flexible foundation** for introducing Agentic AI into Marketing operations without disrupting existing enterprise platforms.
